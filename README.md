# lobe-frontend-practice

This is just a simply one page site I made to further practice my CSS. It's my attempt at recreating
this page: https://www.lobe.ai/tour

Found this site through https://www.frontendpractice.com/

 This is a good site to practice your webdev skills. They have
all kinds of sites for different skill levels that you can recreate.
